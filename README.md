# RWD Responsive design

As a user, I want the dimensions and colors of the application to change so that I can have a unique view in desktop, mobile, and tablet viewports.

    1. Used Flexbox for styling this application.
    2. Used relative units so the elements scale proportionally when the viewport dimensions change.
    3. Used at least two breakpoints and changed the background colors of each box.
    4. Three possible views: desktop, tablet, and mobile device. You may choose the exact pixel values for each breakpoint
